# For example, if your anti-virus daemon is not running,
# the program counts these errors and when the number of errors reaches
# the max_errors level, it begins to answer OK.

# Examples: /tmp/clamd or /var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl or /var/run/clamav
clamd_socket = /var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl

# *** Kaspersky (AVP) daemon ***

# If unsure, say false

# *** Spam scanning messages from the local senders ***
# Scan messages if they were sent from the IPs defined in the local_networks.
# Attention! This can cause problems if you have some relays
# in the local_networks range, as incoming messages will have their IPs.
# So don't forget to exclude those relays from local_networks.
# If unsure, say false, because spam scanning process is so time consuming.

# *** Spam message action ***
# What to do when spam was detected.
# Actions: none, reject, discard, addheader, addheaderjunk, addheaderall
# none - do nothing, no spam scanning
# reject - bounce message,
# discard - remove silently,
# addheader - add the spam_header
# addheaderjunk - add the header X-Junk-Score
# addheaderall - add the spam header to all messages whether they are spam
# or not. You should definitely enable spam_level_header to allow users
# defining their own rules and set local_networks to avoid scanning
# outgoing mail in this mode
# The text of the spam mail header is defined in the spam_header option below.
# If unsure, set it to addheaderjunk
spam_action = addheaderjunk

# *** Spam mail header ***
# The program adds default header like
# X-Spam-Status: Yes, hits=18.7 required=5.0 tests=GTUBE

# signs indicates the level of spam.
# For example, hits=5 and X-Spam-Level: *****
# Then users can filter such messages in their e-mail clients.
# For example, they can define to filter messages containing the header
# X-Spam-Level: ***** , another words the messages with spam hits >= 5.
# If unsure, set it to false
spam_level_header = false

# *** Spam level header char ***
# If the spam_level_header is enabled, this char will indicate the spam level.
# There is a problem in CommuniGate Pro rules that prevents using
# the default '*' sign. Use another one, e.g. 'x'.
# Then your set of rules can look like:
# Header Field is X-Spam-Level: xxxxxxxx*
# store in spam_folder
# Header Field is X-Spam-Level: xxxxxxxx*
# discard

# *** Extra spam score ***
# Spam filter counts spam score for every message.
# When this score is low, the program runs the default spam_action.

# extra_spam_action. This is useful to reject obvious spam,
# for example, from blacklisted domains.
# If unsure, set it to 15

# *** Maximum message scan size ***
# If a message is larger in bytes than specified in this option,
# only the first max_spamscan_size bytes will be scanned.
# The size is smaller, the scanning is faster.
# Set it in bytes: 65536, kilobytes: 50K, megabytes: 1M

# *** Domain aliases ***
# The option is useful when your domains have several aliases.
# Its purpose is to have the same user settings for several domains.
# Format: mail.domain.com => domain.com, smtp.domain.com => domain.com
# Then user@mail.domain.com will have the settings of user@domain.com
